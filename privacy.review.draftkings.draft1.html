<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>
    This chart evaluates DraftKings' privacy practices based on various criteria, scored on a scale from 1 to 10. Some criteria have a <strong>positive impact</strong> on privacy if they score lower (like "Necessity of the App/Service"). In contrast, others have a <strong>negative impact</strong> if they score higher (like "Extent of Data Collection"). The weights assigned to each criterion reflect its relative importance to overall privacy.
</p>

<h4>How the Overall Score is Calculated</h4>
<p>
    Instead of directly averaging the scores, we use a weighted formula to calculate the final score, with certain categories being more influential based on their weight.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step-by-Step</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>For positive criteria like "Necessity of the App/Service," the formula adjusts the score by calculating <code>10 - score</code>, because lower values are better for privacy. This adjusted score is then multiplied by its weight.</li>
    <li> The raw score is multiplied by its weight for negative criteria because higher scores represent more privacy concerns.</li>
    <li>The total weighted scores are added together and then divided by the sum of the weights to produce the overall score.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>1. DraftKings Collects Extensive Data</h3>
    <p>DraftKings collects a wide range of data from its users—some that are expected for account management, and others that raise more complex privacy concerns.</p>

    <strong>Basic Identifiable Information</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>DraftKings collects personal information such as your name, address, email, and phone number. While this is standard for most services, this data can also be shared with third-party advertisers and service providers to enhance targeting efforts, raising concerns about how much control users truly have over their personal information once it’s shared.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Financial and Government Information</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>DraftKings requires users to provide highly sensitive financial data, including banking information and payment card details, as well as a social security number (or equivalent) for account verification. This information is used to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations and financial reporting laws.</li>
        <li>In addition, government-issued identification (such as a driver’s license or passport) is required to comply with gaming regulations and to verify the user’s age. This type of information is not only sensitive, but if stored improperly or for extended periods, could be at risk. </li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Biometric Data</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Perhaps the most significant privacy concern involves DraftKings’ use of facial recognition for identity verification. This means DraftKings collects, analyzes, and retains biometric identifiers like facial scans, which are far more sensitive than traditional forms of data.</li>
        <li>Biometric data is particularly concerning because, unlike a password or a credit card number, it cannot be reset or changed if compromised. The storage and use of biometric data have been increasingly scrutinized under laws like the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). In [Patel v. Facebook, Inc. (2019)], Facebook faced a major class-action lawsuit under BIPA, which resulted in a $650 million settlement for unlawfully collecting and storing users' biometric data (facial recognition) without explicit consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="why-this-matters">
        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>1. The collection and storage of biometric data, such as facial scans, introduce major privacy risks. Unlike passwords, biometric identifiers like your face or fingerprint cannot be changed if compromised. Breaches involving biometric data could have irreversible effects, as seen in incidents where facial recognition data has been stolen.</p>
        <p>2. Under the Illinois BIPA and similar laws, companies must obtain explicit consent before collecting biometric information and must outline how long the data will be retained. In the [Rosenbach v. Six Flags Entertainment Corp. (2019)] case, the Illinois Supreme Court held that even technical violations of BIPA, without showing harm, can result in significant legal consequences. This case is a precedent for holding companies accountable for the improper handling of biometric data.</p>
        <p>3. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enforces strict rules on data retention and requires companies to minimize the amount of personal data they store. DraftKings retains biometric data for up to a year, which may exceed the “data minimization” requirements under GDPR, which demand that data be kept only for as long as necessary for the original purpose.</p>
        <p>4. Data retention practices surrounding biometric information are crucial, as longer retention increases exposure to risk. In [Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins (2016)], the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that even intangible harms from improper data handling (such as inaccurate data retention or unauthorized sharing) could constitute a violation of user rights under certain circumstances, reinforcing the need for tighter controls.</p>
    </div>



    <h3>2. Behavioral Tracking and Location Data – Pervasive Monitoring Across Platforms</h3>
    <p>DraftKings’ data collection extends far beyond basic personal information. They actively monitor your location, browsing activity, and device information, which allows for pervasive tracking across multiple platforms and devices:</p>

    <strong>Location Tracking</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>DraftKings uses your location data to ensure compliance with local gaming laws. This helps the platform verify that users are within legal jurisdictions that allow sports betting or online gaming.</li>
        <li>However, this tracking isn’t a one-time verification. It’s continuous and persistent, meaning each time you access the app or platform, your geographical position is logged. This kind of ongoing location monitoring has raised legal and privacy questions, especially in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in *Carpenter v. United States (2018)*, which held that continuous tracking of a person’s location through cell phone data requires a warrant. This ruling demonstrates that even voluntarily shared location data, when aggregated over time, could invoke Fourth Amendment protections.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Behavioral Data</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>In addition to location tracking, DraftKings collects a wide range of behavioral data, including your browsing history, clickstream data (the sequence of clicks you make on a website), and your interactions on both their website and mobile app.</li>
        <li>They use tracking technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, and device identifiers to monitor your behavior across devices. This enables them to build a comprehensive profile of your online habits, preferences, and engagement patterns. A notable legal precedent here is *United States v. Jones (2012)*, where the Supreme Court discussed how continuous and aggregated tracking of behaviors can constitute a "search" under the Fourth Amendment, especially when it reveals detailed personal information.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="why-this-matters">
        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>1. Continuous behavioral and location tracking can create an intimate profile of your habits, preferences, and routines. The aggregation of this data over time, especially across platforms, provides companies like DraftKings and their partners with a detailed picture of your personal life, interests, and daily activities. *Carpenter v. United States (2018)* confirmed that such data can reveal enough about a person’s private life that it requires stronger legal protections, as it may constitute an invasion of privacy.</p>
        <p>2. DraftKings shares this data with third-party advertisers to serve you targeted ads. This data is not just confined to improving your gaming experience—it’s a part of a broader profiling system designed to monetize your behavior through targeted advertising. Cases like *Riley v. California (2014)* have shown that personal data stored on devices (like browsing history or app usage) deserves protection, underscoring the importance of user consent and transparency in such pervasive data collection practices.</p>
        <p>3. The technologies used for behavioral tracking, such as cookies and pixel tags, have been subject to regulatory scrutiny, particularly under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. Under GDPR, companies are required to obtain explicit consent before collecting such data and must provide users with the ability to opt out of tracking. Non-compliance has resulted in significant fines for companies like Google and Facebook, highlighting the risks of improper data handling.</p>
    </div>


    <h3>3. Data Sharing with a Wide Network – Who Really Has Access to Your Information?</h3>
    <p>The scope of data sharing is extensive, involving multiple categories of recipients:</p>
        <strong>Service Providers</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>DraftKings shares data with third parties for various purposes, including identity verification, fraud prevention, and customer support.</li>
                <li>This includes entities like ThreatMetrix for threat detection, which receives unique identifiers and behavior data to assess potential risks.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <strong>Advertising Partners</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>DraftKings partners with advertising networks like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok to deliver targeted ads.</li>
            <li>This means your activities are shared with these networks, allowing them to refine your consumer profile.</li>
            <li>These advertising platforms use data from your interactions on DraftKings, including your browsing habits, game preferences, and other user activities, to build a more detailed understanding of your interests. This refined profile is then used to show you personalized ads that are more relevant to your preferences and behavior.</li>
            <li>Such data sharing enables advertisers to place their ads in front of users who are most likely to engage, improving their advertising efficiency. However, this also raises privacy concerns, as users may not always be aware of the extent to which their data is collected, shared, and used for advertising purposes.</li>
            <li>While DraftKings and its advertising partners benefit from this arrangement through improved targeting, users should understand that their activities across various platforms contribute to a detailed profile shared between multiple parties, potentially without full transparency or user control.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <strong>Law Enforcement</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>DraftKings may disclose your personal information to law enforcement if required by legal processes, such as subpoenas. </li>
                <li>While this is standard practice, the broad language in such policies raises concerns about the scope of cooperation and potential overreach.</li>
                <li> Historically, under the third-party doctrine [Smith v. Maryland (1979)], when consumers shared information with third parties, they lost their expectation of privacy. As a result, third parties could disclose information to law enforcement when legally required, often with limited safeguards. However, the evolving mosaic theory [United States v. Jones (2012)] challenges this by arguing that while individual data points may seem insignificant, when aggregated over time, they can reveal a detailed and highly sensitive profile of a consumer. This profile could expose intimate aspects of one’s life (such as location history or transaction records), potentially protected by the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. For example, tracking someone’s behavior over weeks or months can create a "mosaic" of their daily routines, social connections, and personal habits.</li>
            </ul>
    <div class="why-this-matters">
        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>1. When DraftKings shares data with advertising networks, it effectively becomes a joint controller of your data.</p>
        <p>2. Privacy obligations differ across jurisdictions, which may expose your data to weaker protections.</p>
        <p>3. The potential for onward transfers further complicates things, creating a scenario where your data could travel beyond the initially disclosed recipients.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>4. Biometric Data Processing – Understanding the Risks and Implications</h3>
    <p>DraftKings uses third-party vendors like Onfido for biometric verification. Biometric data requires robust safeguards:</p>
        <strong>Retention Period</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Biometric data is retained for up to a year post-verification, which might seem short, but a breach during this period could have long-term consequences.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <strong>Vendor Relationship</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Onfido, as a processor, handles the biometric data, but ultimately, accountability falls on DraftKings if there’s misuse or a breach.</li>
                <li>The transfer and storage of biometric data, particularly to jurisdictions with differing privacy standards, could elevate risk.</li>
            </ul>
        

    <div class="why-this-matters">
        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>1. The collection and processing of biometric data without stringent safeguards could violate privacy laws like BIPA or CCPA, exposing both DraftKings and users to potential liabilities.</p>
        <p>2. Moreover, biometric data has inherently more severe consequences if compromised than other data types.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>5. No Acknowledgment of Do Not Track (DNT) Signals – A Missed Privacy Opportunity</h3>
    <p>The policy explicitly states that DraftKings does not honor DNT requests, which means they will continue tracking users across the web even if they’ve opted out via their browser.</p>

    <div class="why-this-matters">
        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>1. The failure to honor DNT reflects, in my opinion, a broader industry issue where self-regulation falls short.</p>
        <p>2. California’s CCPA introduced the Global Privacy Control (GPC), akin to DNT, to give users more control over their data.</p>
        <p>3. DraftKings’ disregard for such signals means users lose a layer of control, and transparency needed for an informed decision diminishes.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>6. Vague Data Retention Policy – How Long Do They Really Keep Your Data?</h3>
    <p>The policy states that DraftKings will retain personal data "for as long as needed to fulfill its purpose." This ambiguity leaves room for prolonged data retention beyond what users may be comfortable with.</p>

    <div class="why-this-matters">
        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>1. Under privacy principles like data minimization, organizations should only retain data as long as necessary.</p>
        <p>2. A lack of clarity here could indicate a disregard for best practices, increasing risks of over-retention and misuse.</p>
        <p>3. This is another example where corporations will disregard best practices when our regulators fail to force them.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>7. Use of User Data in Public Promotions – A Hidden License Grant</h3>
    <p>DraftKings states that if you participate in games or social features, your profile information, including name, image, and betting data, can be used for promotional purposes without additional consent.</p>
        <strong>Publicity License</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>By participating, you effectively grant DraftKings a royalty-free, worldwide license to use your likeness for advertising purposes.</li>
                <li>Users should be fully informed of this hidden license grant.</li>
            </ul>
        

    <div class="why-this-matters">
        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>1. Such a clause raises concerns about moral rights and the right to control how your identity is used.</p>
        <p>2. Users may face long-term reputational implications if their information is used in contexts they disagree with.</p>
    </div>


    <p>The ultimate takeaway? Informed consent should be truly informed.</p>
